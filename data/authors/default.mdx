Currently building [dhyƒÅna](https://www.dhyanajournal.com), the meditation and self-reflection AI journal

Going to start working on [weekability](https://github.com/shouryan01/weekability) - an AI powered finance tracker

I'm passionate about open-source software and on-device ML

In my free time I like to work-out, cook, read and hike
