# Google-Tasks-Desktop

I am a heavy user of Google Tasks. I love the easy integration between all the Google services such as Gmail, Calendar and Keep. The mobile app is also excellent. However, Google forces you to use Google Tasks in this terrible interface:

## Resource Use

This is no comparison. An optimized-native M1 Mac app vs Google Chrome? Not fair. To make it more fair, Google Chrome is an unused browser (I use Firefox!). EVEN then, Google Tasks running as a sidebar app in Gmail uses 10x more memory and 6x more CPU than Google Tasks Desktop.

That's it! The app is a no-nonsense wrapper around Google Tasks, it just works! This implementation meets all my needs and I am satisfied with it. I hope someone else also finds use from it.
