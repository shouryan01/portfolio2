## I love playing rock-paper-scissors.

But the thing is, humans will get tired of playing against me. For an aspiring world champion of playing rock paper scissors, I needed to keep practicing for 23 our of 24 hours of the day.

I used MediaPipe to train a model to recognize different hand shapes I was making. I trained three classes, rock, paper and scissors. This also ensures nobody pulls out a gun when playing because that is against official rules.

The game then chooses a random sign to play against you. If it is a tie, nobody gets a point. Otherwise, one point is added to the respective player. The game ends when the first player gets 5 points.

So what are you waiting for? Go try out my game!
