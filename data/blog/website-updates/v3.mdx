## V3 Release Notes

The [original project](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) has been upgraded to V2, using the new app router.
I've been meaning to upgrade my portfolio website.

I have taken this opportunity to simplify my personal webpage. Some features which I thought were cool are now just annoying like:

1. The animated cursor pattern on the home page. This is distracting and adds nothing to the website apart from being a neat trick for the first 20 seconds.
2. The hidden scroll bar and the vertical progress bar. In theory, it's "cleaner" but not very usable.
3. The kbar/search bar thing. Nobody will use it including me for taking actions on the website. It's cool, but again just unnecessary. Infact, searching entirely is not needed and has been removed.
4. The home page's scrolling info thing is also not needed; removed!
5. Comments also are not needed, removed!

I've also removed some animations and simplified some charts from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/shouryan01). Turns out, less is more, and the more things you add the slower things load and there more chance for bugs and errors to show.

Things added in this version:

1. Moving all old code changes and customizations to this version
2. Adding analytics
3. Cleaning up the design and keeping things simple
