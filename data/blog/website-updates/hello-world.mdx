# Hello!

## Welcome to my website!

I'll quickly walk you through the construction of this website, and attribute credit to whom I took inspiration from.

## Initial Conception

While scrolling through Reddit, I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/u5l7bi/v5_of_my_portfolio_with_nextjs_opensource/), wherein the author describes V5 of his personal portfolio, advertising that it was open-source. Intrigued, I followed the link back to his repo, and followed it back all the way back to this excellent [repository](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) from which several others have taken and built upon (the repo mentions a few). Thank you so much [Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx) for sharing this amazing creation with the open-source community.

## I appreciate...

How orderly the repository is. It was very straightforward to find exactly what I was looking for and I applaud the author for writing such clean code.

I really liked these features being built in: a comments section and a button to scroll all the way back to the top.

I also appreciate the built-in search box paired with the tagging system.

Finally, I

# LOVE

that there is a built-in, minimalistic dark mode toggle.

## Changes

Of course, the beauty of open-source is that anyone (me) is able to build upon an excellent foundation, and make it completely their own. Although the initial site is completely functional and aesthetically pleasing, there were some personal stylistic changes that I wanted to incorporate. I've written about those in this [blog post](/blog/v1), as well as have detailed planned future releases.
